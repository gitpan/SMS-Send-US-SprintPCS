DESCRIPTION

  Preparing to Use This Driver
    This driver requires acceptance of a disclaimer and conditions of use
    form.

    You "must" manually accept this disclaimer and conditions before you
    will be able to use this driver.

    While we certainly could make the driver do it for you, acceptance of
    the terms of use implies you understand the cost structure and rules
    surrounding the use of SprintPCS text messaging.

  Disclaimer
    Other than dieing on encountering the terms of use form, no other
    protection is provided, and the authors of this driver take no
    responsibility for any costs accrued on your phone bill by using this
    module.

    Using this driver will cost you money. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

METHODS
    "SMS::Send::US::SprintPCS-"new()>
          # Create a new sender using this driver
          my $sender = SMS::Send->new( 'US::SprintPCS' );

    "$sender->send_sms( ... )"
        The "$sender->send_sms( ... )" method accepts two named parameters,
        "text" and "to".

        ANY use may result in charges on the recipients phone bill, and you
        should use this software with care. The author takes no
        responsibility for any such charges accrued.
